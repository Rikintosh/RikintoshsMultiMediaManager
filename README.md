# Rikintosh's MultiMedia Manager

I have always missed a good game manager for my old computers. Formatting and reinstalling my favorite games is a lot of work, in ms-dos games I have to configure the correct sound card for each of them, create icons on the desktop and then (for my taste) look for icons for games that do not have it.



So I decided to create a frontend / manager, similar to the Launchbox bigbox, but mine will be 100% free, and dedicated only to old games.



My proposal is that your retro computer should be a console. "What would the xbox look like if it had been released in the mid-90s?"



What if your retro computer was on the living room TV?



Furthermore, OPTIONALLY, it will offer a feature that will clean up the entire system, and remove everything that is obsolete or unnecessary (such as a console's operating system). The advantage of this is that in addition to gaining many megabytes of HD space, there will be more RAM available. I've always been fascinated, as consoles can run games with so little ram (PS2 = 32mb, PS1 = 2mb, Apple Pippin = 6MB, N64 = 4mb) so why not a Pentium 1 with 8Mb of ram instead of 16 or 32 ? (Yes, I know the technical details, some consoles have faster memories, games are hardcodded to manage memory more efficiently) but my focus is, because (for example) having a wallpaper management service taking up precious memory (we all know how poorly optimized windows wallpaper management is until xp, it converts jpg photos to bmp for to be able to display them, which takes up large amounts of memory, as well as the active desktop) when using a frontend? Or an html page management service, when an old computer wants to be able to connect to the internet?



Features that will be present:



- You install or place your games in a certain folder, and it will scan, and your games will appear on the frontend with your name, release date, description, rating, cover photo, and screenshots.



- It can work in a similar way to recalbox or retropie: If your computer has a network card, you can transfer games via the network, and also manage database information via the network



- A user profile system (similar to the xbox gamertag), it will manage the saved games of all games, and there will be a "gamescore" that will be points for every minute you spent playing.

Your savegame can be transferred to a floppy disk or USB stick.



- A game packaging system, to facilitate the transfer between systems. What does that mean? It means that if you want to copy the game "doom" to your other retro machine, the frontend will be in charge of compressing the game in a single file, adding all the necessary information to the database (cover photo, screenshots), in case the database on the other computer does not have information about the game.



- Built-in VCD and DVD Player, in addition to a music player with support for many formats, including mod, xm, it (keygen music)



- Multi-languages, all interface texts are strings, which will be loaded from a simple txt file. Some languages will be available at launch, but if your preferred language is not available, you can easily translate by editing the file in Notepad.



- Customizable! All graphics are customizable, just create a folder with the name of your theme, place the files of the default theme, and edit them. Then, in the frontend, go to themes, and choose your custom theme folder



- I tried to add some support for internet browsing, but itâ€™s really very difficult to do, maybe in a next edition, which uses windows xp as a base, dedicated to also managing games from the 2000s



I was a little bold, and I designed a cabinet, keyboard and joystick, for those who want to imagine that it really is a standard architecture.
